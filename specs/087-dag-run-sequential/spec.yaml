  input: |
    DAG Run Sequential - Core execution engine for DAG multi-spec orchestration.
    Create worktrees, run specs sequentially, track state. Commands: `autospec dag run <file>`
    for executing DAG workflow in sequential mode, `autospec dag list` for listing all DAG runs.
    Key deliverables: Parse dag.yaml using existing parser, create worktree per spec using
    worktree.Manager, run `autospec run -spti` in each worktree sequentially, respect layer
    dependencies (L0 completes before L1 starts), persist run state in
    `.autospec/state/dag-runs/<run-id>.yaml`, provide terminal output with [spec-id] prefixes,
    and create per-spec log files in `.autospec/logs/dag-runs/<run-id>/`.
